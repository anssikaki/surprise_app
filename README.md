# Feedback Buddy

A playful Streamlit application where customers can share feedback about a product or service and instantly get an AIâ€‘generated action plan.

The `surprise_app.py` module provides helper functions used in the tests and defines a simple UI. If the `streamlit` or `openai` packages are not installed, lightweight fallbacks allow the module to be imported during testing.
