# Ethics Radar

A small Streamlit application for exploring ethical, legal and reputational risks of a business idea.

The `surprise_app.py` module provides helper functions used in the tests and defines a simple UI. If the `streamlit` and `openai` packages are not installed, lightweight fallbacks are used so the module can still be imported during testing.
